BOOKLIST

Generates a nice html book list from an XML file.
Example available at http://codespoon.info/~avuori/books/list.py

Written by Arto Vuori somewhere around 2003.

It is easy to support several book lists without code duplication. See examples list.py and sanna.py.

The XML data file examples are available in the bookdata directory. Unfortunately the DTD that is referenced somewhere in booklist.py is no longer available (lost forever).
